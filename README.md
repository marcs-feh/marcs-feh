Every software I create as a hobby is Libre, usually under a permissive license. The main target of my programs is POSIX systems, however Windows ports are never out of question if they are not super difficult to implement.

My most used/loved languages are:

- Go
- C/C++
- Odin
- Lua
- Python

Tools I use:

- C/C++ : Clang with AddressSanitizer and clangd as LSP, `lldb` for debugger.
- Go : The language already comes with all the essentials.
- Editor : Neovim, I can tolerate most editors if they have vim-keys, but Neovim is by far my favorite.
- Desktop : Mostly suckless programs, check `marcs-feh/sukless`.

NOTE: Yes, I do write C/C++ just to annoy programmers of both languages
