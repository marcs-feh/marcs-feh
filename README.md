I have a personal appreciation for CSP-style concurrency and minimalist software.

I'm something of a Libre software simp. Every software I create as a hobby is Libre, usually under a permissive license. The main target of my programs is POSIX systems, however Windows ports are never out of question if they are not super difficult to implement. I currently use Linux, but I can find my way around most POSIX systems, I don't work on proprietary systems unless I'm being paid.

My most used/loved languages are:
- C (C17, ANSI C if I *really* have to)
- Go
- Lua
- Python

Tools I use:

- C/C++ : Clang with AddressSanitatizer and clangd as LSP, `lldb` for debugger.
- Go : The language already comes with the essentials.
- Editor : Neovim, I can tolerate most editors if they have vim-keys, but Neovim is by far my favorite.
- Desktop : Mostly suckless programs, check `marcs-feh/sukless`.
