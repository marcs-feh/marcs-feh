Every software I create as a hobby is Libre, usually under a permissive license. The main target of my programs is POSIX systems, however Windows ports are never out of question if they are not super difficult to implement.

Tools I use:

- C/C++ : Clang with AddressSanitizer and clangd as LSP, `lldb` for debugger.
- Go : The language already comes with all the essentials.
- Editor : Neovim, I can tolerate most editors if they have vim-keys, but Neovim is by far my favorite, check `marcs-feh/nvim_config`
- Desktop : Mostly minimalist programs, check `marcs-feh/sukless` for my X11 setup or `marcs-feh/dotfiles` for Wayland and general configs.

NOTE: Yes, I do write C/C++ just to annoy programmers of both languages
